# Task 2: Target Groups

1. As an individual participant in the group, take three sticky notes and on each of them: write down a target group you believe the product serves
2. Place the sticky notes on a wall and review each of them together
3. Group similar target groups together and eliminate all redundancies
4. As a group, select the three most important target groups from those remaining
5. Discuss who the target groups are and any important information we might know about them, including: professional backgrounds, general attitude, buying sensitivity, and so on.&#x20;
