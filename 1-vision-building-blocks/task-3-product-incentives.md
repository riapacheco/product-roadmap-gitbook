# Task 3: Product Incentives

1. As an individual participant in the group, take three sticky notes and on each of them: write down a product incentive (value proposition, positive outcome, necessary requirement) that you believe we deliver to our customers
2. Place the sticky notes on a wall and review each of them together
3. Group similar Incentives together and eliminate redundancies
4. As a group, select the three most important incentives from those remaining
5. Discuss what those incentives might mean from each participant's perspective and record "Why it's important"

| Incentive | Title                          | Why it's important                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|     1     | Data Management Infrastructure | Data acquisition methods, processes, and tools are well established for the Drilling vertical but not for completions - data is broken across well lifetime stages                                                   |
|     2     | Shareable Data                 | Enabling a system that shares data across departments ensures that we do not have to build 2 separate platforms; since we instead can approach the customer as an enterprise organization (instead of by department) |
|     3     | Well Activity Recognition      | Give us competitive edge                                                                                                                                                                                             |
