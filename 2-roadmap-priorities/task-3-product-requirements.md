# Task 3: Product Requirements

1. Create a table that lists `Stop`, `Start`, `Continue`, `Difficulty`, and `Priority` along the top header row
2. Given what was discovered in previous exercises, begin listing what the team should _stop, start,_ and _continue_ when it comes to the product and our customers
   1. For each listed item, fill out a corresponding _Difficulty_ level. Some example labels might be: \
      <mark style="color:yellow;">**Easy, Normal, Challenging, Hard, Unknown**</mark>
   2. For each listed item, fill out a corresponding _Priority_ level. Some example labels might be: \
      <mark style="color:yellow;">**Highest, High, Med-High, Medium, Normal, Low, Lowest**</mark>
