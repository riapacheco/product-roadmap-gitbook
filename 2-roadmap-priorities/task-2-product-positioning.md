# Task 2: Product Positioning

1. Create a table that:
   1. Lists the target groups in the far-left column
   2. Includes one column to the right labelled "NOW"
   3. Has 3 following columns labelled with each objective established in Part I, Task 1.
2. In the "NOW" column, for each target group ask:\
   _<mark style="color:yellow;">**How does \[target group] currently think and feel about the product?**</mark>_
3. After completing the "NOW" column, move on the remaining sections and ask:\
   _<mark style="color:yellow;">**"To accomplish \[objective], how SHOULD \[target group] think about our product?"**</mark>_

The outcome of this task helps us better prioritize product requirements
