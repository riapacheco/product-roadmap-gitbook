description: Determine product incentives' level of appeal for each target group
---

# Task 1: Target Group Focus

1. Create a table that lists the target groups in the far-left header column and lists the established Product Incentives along the top header row
2. For each target group, ask: \
   _<mark style="color:yellow;">**"Why would \[TargetGroup1] care about \[ProductIncentive1]"**</mark>_\
   __It's important to be as honest as possible during this exercise
3. Record your answers in their appropriate cells

|       \[Target Groups]      | Data Infrastructure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Shareable Data                                                                                             | Activity Data Recognition                                                                              |

| **Data Focused Executives** | <ul><li>Data strategies largely experimental and can't afford long-term hardware infrastructure plays</li><li>Wants to allot most of budget to data team competencies over infrastructure</li><li>Have biggest stake in acquiring insights that will impact enterprise</li></ul> | Easier to validate investment if serving multiple departments (including those outside data-focused depts) | Would want more activities detected but with more flexible formatting                                  |
|     **Completions OSRs**    | Does **not** care about data management infrastructure                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | If given easy reporting, will enable smooth operations and team member accountability (fleet)              | Ability to maximize efficiencies during operations is the point of the completions fleet to begin with |
|      **Frac Engineers**     | Only those engineers who focus on data diversity for plan design will care                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Enables their holding onsite personnel accountable for reporting accuracy                                  | Enables better and more comprehensive frac plans                                                       |
