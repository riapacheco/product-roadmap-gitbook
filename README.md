# Introduction

To cement the product roadmap, the team must align on the business itself, who we're targeting, and the value the product delivers to the customer. To achieve this, I've personally developed a set of exercises that identify the building blocks of the product vision itself and, with those building blocks, prioritizes execution through a customer-focused roadmap.

Complete these exercises with your team in an environment that welcomes participation through discussion and friendly debate.
